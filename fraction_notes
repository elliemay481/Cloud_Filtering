(Tb44/Tb43) > (Tb33/Tb34) = surface
(Tb44/Tb43) < (Tb33/Tb34) = cloudy/humid

In humid and clearsky conditions:
AWS 34(43) is lower than 33(44) due to WV absorption.
Both are above 1.
But at higher humidities, pairs decouple and AWS34 peaks at a slightly higher altitude.
Tb33/Tb34 increases
Tb44/Tb43 < Tb33/Tb34

The closer a channel is to the water vapour line, the more it decouples from its partner at higher humidities. And the group 3 channels tend to move more to higher altitudes than the group 4 channels.
Therefore, in humid conditions, the group 3 ratio will increase more than the group 4 ratio.

In cloudy and humid conditions:
The group 4 channels are more impacted by scattering
AWS44 lower than AWS43 due to scattering. 
AWS34 lower than AWS33 due to scattering. 
The group 4 channels are more impacted by scattering than the group 3 channels.
Since both are less than 1, and Tb44/Tb43 decreases more rapidly than Tb33/Tb34:
(Tb44/Tb43) < (Tb33/Tb34)
Eventually flattens out at high tcwv due to saturation.

Cold surface, clearsky, dry:
AWS 33(44) is lower than 34(43) due to lower peaking channels seeing a cold surface.
Both less than 1.
In the presence of a little water vapour, pairs decouple: 34 starts to looks at higher altitudes and is warmer:
(Tb33/Tb34) decreases more than (Tb44/Tb43).
(Tb44/Tb43) > (Tb33/Tb34)

So even though the pairs decouple here as we had in the humid, warm conditions, the difference lies in the fact that the ratios are above or below 1.

Would we see the same thing looking at differences rather than ratios? Why would ratios help more than differences, or not?

170 / 190

then increase as both stop seeing surface
ratio of 44/43 increases to about 1

for 0.3 and [0.3, 0.2]:
at first: (Tb44/Tb43) > (Tb33/Tb34)
43 reacts 'more' to presence of wv than 34, sees slightly higher altitude
switches to (Tb44/Tb43) < (Tb33/Tb34) when none seeing surface (saturation?)
[0.3, 0.4]:
quite similar, but do have (Tb44/Tb43) < (Tb33/Tb34)
group 4 starts off at lower tb, so ???

arctic cloudy:
quick decrease from 1
44 lower than 43 - more scattering
ratio of 44/43 decreases below 1
at low wv: (Tb44/Tb43) > (Tb33/Tb34)
at high wv: (Tb44/Tb43) < (Tb33/Tb34)



(Tb44/Tb43) > (Tb33/Tb34) = good
44*34 > 33*43

44*34 / 33*43 > 1  = good

44*34 / 33*43 < 1  = bad

basically we're trying to remove cloudy tropical, i think??
